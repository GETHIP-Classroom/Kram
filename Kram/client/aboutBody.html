          <p>
            Kram is a tool to enhance the experience of studying for the ACT, SAT, and even AP Tests. As an organization our mission is to individualize
            our programs to our users so they can have the best time possible. Kram was created by six high school students as a part
            of the Gallup Education Taskforce High School Internship Program. Their overall goal was to make the grueling task of studying
            for the ACT easier on students across the country.
