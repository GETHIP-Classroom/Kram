            Kram is a tool to enhance the experience of studying for the ACT. As an organization our mission is to individualize
            our programs to our users so the can have the best time possible. Kram was created by six high school students as apart
            of the Gallup Education Taskforce High School Internship Program, their overall goal was to make the grueling task of studying
            for the ACT on students across the country.
